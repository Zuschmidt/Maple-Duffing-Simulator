# Maple-Duffing-Simulator
The following program is taken from Maple. The program takes use inputter initial conditions for the dynamic system, then uses the Runge-Kutta method to solve the Duffing differential equation. It then plots the Poincar√© section and exports the data to an 'xduf' and 'vduf' file.
